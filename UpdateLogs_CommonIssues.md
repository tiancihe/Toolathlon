- [2025/12/12] Using Claude models via AWS Bedrock backend will sometimes leads to errors like this, we suggeet using Anthropic's official endpoint instead.

    {"title":"Bad request","detail":"{\"message\":\"Expected toolResult blocks at messages.2.content for the following Ids: tooluse_z1WOsx8aThCAfWyK14mgEQ\"}","status":400}

- [2025/12/12] We add a new model provider `openai_stateful_responses` to support the Responses API for official OpenAI models. We suggest using this model provider instead of the `unified` model provider (based on ChatCompletions API) when using official OpenAI models to keep the consistency of the thinking contents generated by the model.
